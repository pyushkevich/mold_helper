Building a Mold using a 9.4T MRI scan of the MTL
================================================
In this tutorial, we address a harder task, where the MRI scan of the MTL specimen is on a 9.4T scanner and has distortions that require correction. For this, we will use a 7T MRI scan of the whole hemisphere (without distortions) as a reference. This requires additional steps of registering the 9.4T MRI to the 7T MRI. 

Step 1. Download Input MRI Scans
--------------------------------

1. Create a new folder for each mold-making project. All files should be saved in this folder. 

2. The *first* required input to this protocol is the 9.4T MRI scan of the entire MTL, which should be converted to the NiFTI file format and saved as named :code:`mtl_94t.nii.gz`. Note that this is not the overnight high-resolution scan, but a shorter scan that covers the entire sample. 

3. The *second* required input to this protocol is the 7T MRI scan of the hemisphere, which should be converted to the NiFTI file format and saved as named :code:`hemi_7t.nii.gz`. 

Step 2. Segment the specimen on the 9.4T scan
---------------------------------------------
1. Open the 9.4T scan as the main image in ITK-SNAP. Adjust contrast so the image is visible well.

2. Segment the specimen using the same way as in :ref:`Step 2 <mtl7t-seg>` of :doc:`mold7T`, but with the following important differences:

   * Because the 9.4T MRI scan is anisotropic (voxel dimensions in x,y and z are different), we need to make it isotropic by resampling. Before pressing the `Segment 3D` button in ITK-SNAP, check the `Resample ROI` box, and in the dialog that pops up, select `Presets->Supersample to Isotropic`
  
   * When you save the contour, name it :code:`contour_image_94t.nii.gz`.
  
   * After you save the contour and press the `Finish` button (return to main ITK-SNAP mode), save your segmentation image (`Segmentation->Save Segmentation Image`) and name it :code:`mtl_mask_94t.nii.gz`

   * After you finish this step, keep the images loaded in ITK-SNAP

Step 3. Rigid/Affine registration of the hemisphere 7T to the MTL 9.4T
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. With the 9.4T MRI and the segmentation still loaded in ITK-SNAP, load the 7T hemisphere scan as an additional image (`File->Add Another Imageâ€¦`)
2. Enter the registration mode (`Tools->Registration`). Select the `Manual` tab. 
3. Rotate and move the hemisphere image until it roughly aligns with the MTL image. 

   .. image:: images/hemireg1.png

4. Use the button at the bottom of the registration panel (floppy disk icon) to save the current registration parameters. Call the file :code:`initial.mat`. Make sure that the file is saved to the same folder where the rest of the mold files are located.
5. Select the automatic tab. Make sure the selected options are `Rigid` for transformation model, `Cross-correlation` for image similarity metric, and `Use segmentation as mask` is selected. Under multi-resolution schedule, select `4x` for coarsest and `1x` for finest. 

   .. image:: images/hemireg3.png

6. Press `Run Registration`. Confirm that the registration gets better visually, not worse. 
   * If the registration gets worse after this step, try using a different set of initial registration parameters by rotating/moving the 7T MRI manually. 
7. Save the current registration parameters as :code:`rigid.mat`
8. Select `Affine` under the transformation model, and run registration again. If it does not get worse, save as :code:`affine.mat`. 
   * If it does get worse, reload the rigid registration parameters and just save them again as :code:`affine.mat`. 
   * If all goes well, you should see a registration result like this:

   .. image:: images/hemireg2.png

Step 4. Deformable registration of the hemisphere 7T to the MTL 9.4T
--------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Open a terminal window. Make sure that the directory containing `mold_helper.sh` is in your PATH. You can do this by typing:

   .. code:: bash

      PATH=/home/user/.../path/to/mold_helper:$PATH
      export PATH

2. Change directory to the folder containing your files:

   .. code:: bash

      cd /home/user/.../workdir

3. Perform deformable registration by running this command, which should take a few minutes to run.

   .. code:: bash

      mold_helper.sh reg_mtl_to_hemi

4. Open a new ITK-SNAP. Load :code:`hemi_7t.nii.gz` as the main image, and the newly created image :code:`mtl7t.nii.gz` as an additional image. Configure ITK-SNAP to display :code:`mtl7t.nii.gz` as a semi-transparent overlay, and adjust the color map and transparency similar to the screenshot below. Check that the registration between the two images is good visually.  

   .. image:: images/hemireg4.png

5. Save the ITK-SNAP workspace as :code:`INDD123456_mtl2hemi.itksnap`  

Step 5. Generate a Mold
-----------------------
Proceed to :ref:`Step 3 <mtl7t-mold>` in :doc:`mold7T` and complete all the remaining steps. Use the same working folder and save **all the files** generated above together with the files generated during mold creation.
